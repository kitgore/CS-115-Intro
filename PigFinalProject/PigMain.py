'''
4-Dice Pig, this time with classes!

Adapted from Java to Python by David Treder, 12/2020

---

For your final project, we are going to revisit the Pig game we programmed
for a previous lab. If you need a refresher for the rules for pig, just check
back on the previous lab. All the rules are the same for this assignment.

Just like in the previous assignment, we have provided the structure the code
should follow. All you have to do is fill in the blanks! Unlike previous
assignments, this game is broken up into multiple files. Make sure you
implement all the missing functions in all the files.

Also, this time the AI is not optional. Donâ€™t worry though, we have provided
enough of a skeleton to lead you to the right solutions.

You may need to add additional functions to help get your code working. Feel
free to do that, just try to avoid renaming existing functions. That can
mess up our testing.

On a similar note, do not change the names of the files provided to you.
We may be testing individual classes which requires the name to be predictable.

Good luck!
